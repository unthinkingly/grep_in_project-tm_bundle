Allows you to use grep to search your project (much faster than project find in Textmate for large project)

99% of this is from http://henrik.nyh.se/2007/06/grep-in-project-command-for-textmate

I just added some support to ignore tmp and log directories.

To Install:

	cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/
	git clone git://github.com/wiseleyb/grep_in_project-tm_bundle.git Grep.tmbundle

Restart Textmate

To use:

shift-command-f
